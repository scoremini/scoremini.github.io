      <h2>How do I start a new match on the Tennis Score Mini app?</h2>
      <p>
        To start a new match on the Tennis Score Mini app, open the app on your Apple Watch and you will see the "New
        Match" screen first.
        You will then be prompted to enter the players' names and choose which player will serve first.
        Once you have entered this information click on the Start Match button to start tracking the score of the match.
      </p>
      <h2>How do I track the score during a match?</h2>
      <p>
        To track the score during a match, simply use the buttons on the app to increment the points, for each player.
        The app will automatically keep track of the current score and update it on the screen.
      </p>
      <h2>How does the app determine the match winner?</h2>
      <p>The app uses the standard rules of tennis to determine the match winner.
        In a typical match, the player who wins six games with a two-game lead over their opponent wins the set.
        If the score reaches 6-6, a tie-break is played to determine the winner.
        The player who first wins 2 of a 3 sets wins the match.
        The app will automatically keep track of the score and determine the winner based on these rules.
